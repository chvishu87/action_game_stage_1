Description:
	The framework given is used to do the project. In this project I created sprites with the animations I designed. Multiple sprites are created and stored in a vector. The initial attributes of the sprites are being retrieved from the XML file. All the sprites attributes are uptaded everytime to create a moving animation of the sprites. The background is also implemented as a sprite by default but can be disabled and filled with a background color by changing the XML file.

To change the XML file and the animation:

For moving sprites: 
	1. The number of sprites can be changed by changing the count in the <orbCount> tag.
	2. The animation in the sprite can be changed by changing the file name in the <redorbFile> tag. The attributes of the new animation should be updated in <redorbWidth> and the <redorbHeight> tags.

For the background:
	1. The default image in the background can be changed by changing value of <backgroundFile> tag and its attributes should be updated in the <backgroundWidth> and the <backgroundHeight> tags.
	2. To remove the default image from the background change the <backgroundOn> tag's value to "true" and then the color of the background can be changed by changing the <backgroundRed>, <backgroundGreen> and <backgroundBlue> tags.

The Specs that I implemented are:

	1. Own sprites are incorporated.
	2. Multiple sprites are created.
	3. Data access from XML file is done.

The Specs that I was unable to implement are:

	All the mentioned specs are implemented.

Extras:

Used the following tools:
	1. Inkscape and GIMP
	2. Valgrind
